# Face-Recognition
This model has been trained on Colab using the famous "Labelled Faces in the Wild" (LFW-Funnelled) dataset imported from Scikit-Learn
The CNN architecture used is inspired by the "Striving for Simplicity" approach by Springenberg et. al. (2015) who found that max-pooling can be substituted by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks.
The CNN model was built by importing Keras which sits on top of Tensorflow (preconfigured in Colab).
You do not need to install any libraries/modules, you simply need to import them in Colab. 
Develop a high precision Face Recognition model using LFW dataset and Google Colab Notebook. Save the model in Google Drive. Happy Learning!
